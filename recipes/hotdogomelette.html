<h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Hot Dog</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop hot dog into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Mix egg in a bowl & pour into pan.</li>
        <li>Add chopped hot dogs into pan with egg.</li>
        <li>Wait until it can be flipped over, just like you would a pan cake.  Or if you prefer, you can create more of scrambled egg dish and mix it in the pan.</li>
    </ol>
